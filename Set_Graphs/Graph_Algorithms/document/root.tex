\title{Simple Graph Algorithms}
\author{Mohammad Abdulaziz}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this entry, we verify the correctness of a number of simple graph algorithms. These include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Depth-first search
  \item Breadth-first search
  \item A cycle detection algorithm based on depth-first search
  \item The Bellman-Ford algorithm 
\end{itemize}

The entry's main aim is to show case the use of the Set\_Graphs library. Two main features are its
automation setup aimed a verifying executable graph algorithms in a human-readable way and to verify
the algorithms w.r.t.\ the same graph representation, making all of them compatible. The setup we
use here includes using the function package to model loops and reason about their termination, using
records to model program states, and using \emph{locales} to implement parametric as well as
step-wise refinement based verification.
